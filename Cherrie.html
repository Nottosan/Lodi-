             <p class="p2">A Brief History of Slots</p> 
            <img src="slot 2.jpg" class="img2">


             <p class="p1">Before learning how to play this evocative casino game, let’ s go back to the archives to get its memoir. 
                Knowing the game’s history will add spice to your gaming experience. So, the year is 1891, and Sittman & Pitt company
                has engineered the first-ever slot machine in New York City. T
                he machine had 50 playing cards with five (5) drums.</p>

            <p class="p1">You’re probably wondering what cards are doing in slots. That’s understandable. We would probably ask the same question. Here’s why. In our previous article, how to play video poker, we saw slots using similar-looking machines to video poker. So, instead of a 52-card playing deck, slots used 50 cards.</p>

            <p class="p1">The missing cards were the 10 of spades and the Jack (J) of hearts. They were discarded to increase the house edge by halving the chances of acquiring a Royal Flush. Also, that’s why there’s much debate on the similarities of both games among gamblers. Here’s where the name Pokies, referring to slots, came from. Now, you’re up to speed.</p>

                <p class="p1">Therefore, to play the slots, a player had to insert money into the machine and pull the in-place lever. If your reels lined up poker hands, you’d then receive non-monetary pay in terms of drinks and cigars. However, the first automatic slot machine came about in 1895, although the exact date isn’t precise. The inventor being Charles Fey or the ‘Father of Slots.’</p>

                <p class="p1">The automatic slot machine used three (3) reels and five (5) symbols which replaced the playing cards. Fast forward to 1976, and the Fortune Coin Company crafted the 1st video slot. The famous IGT then bought Fortune Coin.</p>

                <p class="p2">Basics of Slots for Beginner</p>

                <p class="p1">Now that you’re familiar with the slots’ history, you can converse with other slot aficionados without feeling out of place. However, before learning the art of playing the game, you’ll need to equip yourself with essential elements of the game. These elements are standard whether you’re playing offline or online.</p>
                
                <p class="p2">1.      Reels</p>

                <p class="p1">Have you ever heard the term ‘spin the reels’ in any casino setting, and you got confused? Reels appear horizontally or column-like across your gaming device. Depending on the slot game you’re playing, you’ll find different icons or symbols within those reels.</p>

                <p class="p1">Slot games, such as classic slots, have three (3) reels. On the other hand, video slots can have five (5), seven (7), or even nine (9) reels. After wagering and spinning, you win if a particular combination of symbols appears on a payline.</p>

                <p class="p2">2.      Paylines</p>
                <p class="p1"> As its name suggests, a payline is a pattern that can make a winning combo. In any slot game you play, you’ll see numbers indicated on either game edge. A payline has rows running from left to right across the slot reels. In addition, paylines can have symbols in one row or alternating rows.</p>
                <p class="p1">Slots pay lines can range from one up to 50 paylines or more. For example, let’s say the slot you’re playing has 50 paylines. 
                    If you activate all paylines with a max bet, you’ll have 50 different winning styles. For beginners, cramming the payline can be intimidating, but worry not. That’s because the slot games automatically show you the winning paylines and payout accordingly. Tapping the max bet button will play all the paylines of that specific slot game at online casinos.</p>
                <p class="p2">3.      Rows</p>
                    <p class="p1">It’s common knowledge what a row is. In slots, they run vertically, and a game can have three or more rows. A combination of specific symbols in one row will give you a payline. However, paylines can’t always appear on one row as they go in all directions as long you have matching symbols.</p>

                    <p class="p2">4.      Symbols</p>
                    <p class="p1">These are icons that spin on the game’s reels. You’re bound to have different symbols depending on the game you’re playing. For example, if you’re playing sports-based slots, you’ll have matching symbols to the specific sport’s theme.

                        The icons have different values, and aligning certain symbols will payout according to their values. High-valued symbols mean higher payouts; the opposite is also true. However, some symbols come with additional properties like bonuses, wilds, and free spins. We’ll expound on this in the next chapter of this article.</p>
                        <p class="p2"> 5.      Payout Table</p>
                    
                        <p class="p1">The payout table is the critical part of gameplay. With sheer luck, you can hack it at slot games. However, flying in blind isn’t advisable. Hence, we would advise you to read your ideal game’s payout table before having a go at it.</p>
                        <p class="p1">The table indicates what symbols have a winning combination or which icons lead to free spins. Also, the table will show you how much you stand to win on particular combos and much more.</p>
                        <p class="p1"> Symbols on Slot Games</p>
                        <p class="p1"> Earlier, we mentioned what symbols are in slots. Here, we’re going to explain what the common slot symbols mean in detail. Matching these symbols in specific combinations will allow you to unwrap the gifts they bear. Note: These icons/symbols vary according to the slot game you’re playing.</p>
                        <p class="p2"> 1.      Wild Symbols </p>
                        <p class="p1"> In Video Poker, a wild card can substitute any card to give you a winning hand. Similarly, when the wild slots icon pops up, it can replace any other symbol to provide you a winning combination. Therefore, the icon gives you boosted winning opportunities. </p>
                        <p class="p2"> 2.      Scatter Symbols </p> 
                        <p class="p1">Although rare to land while playing, this symbol prompts bonus rounds where you can grab free spins, among other prizes. Interestingly, this icon doesn’t have to show up on your combination line to earn you points.</p>
                        <p class="p1">The scatter symbols are usually a gambler’s best allies as they can offer a chance at a progressive jackpot. So, anywhere you see the icon, it means goodies are up next.</p>
                        <p class="p2"> 3.      Sticky Symbols</p>
                        <p class="p1">When you land on this symbol, your reel stays put for several spins. They’re often hard to acquire, but you need only to match two icons to win when you do.</p>
                        <p class="p2">4.      Multiplier Symbols</p>
                        <p class="p1">A multiplier symbol multiplies your winnings should you be lucky enough to land on one. Depending on the slot you’re playing, the multiplier can increase your payout by 4x, 2x, or 6x. Unfortunately, they’re rare symbols and are popular with online slots.</p>
                        <p class="p1">They add a different thrill to the game. Who wouldn’t fancy a multiplier to increase winnings? In some scenarios, wild and scatter symbols could function as multipliers. That would madly escalate your payouts.</p>
                        <p class="p2">5.      Bonus Symbols</p>
                        <p class="p1">When you land a bonus symbol, you’ll steer away from your regular spins and play bonus games or rounds. In the bonus rounds, you might get free spins which will increase your winning chances. However, there’s no full-proof tactic to ensure wins in bonus rounds. So, it all falls to how lucky of a gem you are.</p>
                        <p class="p2">6.      Stacked Symbols</p>
                        <p class="p1">These symbols allow standard icons to occupy more than one slot on a reel. Hence, your chances of acquiring a matching combination are magnified. Fortuitous as it may be, you land a stacked wild symbol, your winning opportunities increase exponentially.</p>
                        <p class="p2">The Guide: How to Play Slots</p>

                        <p class="p2">Types of Online Slots</p>
                        <p class="p1">Slots are commonly determined by the number of reels they possess. In that regard, we have three (3) main types of online slots, as discussed below. </p>
                        <p class="p2">1.      Classic Slots</p>
                        <p class="p1">These variants are also known as 3-reels slots. You’ll also hear them being referred to as ‘one-arm bandits.’ That name comes from the traditional slot machines, which required the player to pull a lever to initiate a spin.</p>
                        <p class="p1">For beginners, these are the best variants to start with. That’s because they’re easy to play, learn, and are fast. Landing three matching symbols at classic slots will win you a jackpot. Although few reels reduce a player’s winning opportunities, classic slots have the best payouts.</p>
                        <p class="p2">2.      Video slots</p>
                        <p class="p1">Also known as 5-reel slots, video slots are an upgrade of the classic slots. They have excellent in-game graphics and entertaining gameplay soundtracks. That would lure in anyone. In addition, they’re the most played slots at online casinos, and they’re the predecessors of modern-day slots.</p>
                        <p class="p1">Automatically, 5-reel slots come with more paylines. Hence, that means that you have enormous winning chances compared to classic slots. Video slots have additional features, such as free spins, which make the game more fascinating.</p>
                        <p class="p2">3.      Progressive Jackpot Slots</p>
                        <p class="p1">These types of slots can increase your bankroll beyond your imagination. Have you ever seen the jackpot amount of a slot game rising by the minute? That’s because every time you and other players bet, part of your wager diverts to contribute to the jackpot. Hence the reason why it’s always displayed by most online platforms, if not all.</p>
                        <p class="p1">Although jackpot winning odds are slender, when you do, you’ll have a bankroll that’ll envy even the house. However, to qualify for the jackpot, you must be wagering with a max bet. The jackpot pools usually reach millions.</p>
                        <p class="p1">These are the significant slot variations popularly played in online casinos. However, there are other types of online slots that you can learn and enjoy playing.</p>
                        <p class="p2">Odds & Payouts</p>
                        <p class="p1">Unlike other casino games, the odds of slot games don’t change; they don’t fluctuate. Payouts vary incumbent on the slot game you’re playing and the game’s software provider. The crucial aspect is to read the paytable of each slot game you love playing.</p>
                        <p class="p1">In slots, you don’t always know the odds of a particular symbol combination. That’s why some people prefer playing other casino games such as video poker to slots. Without a doubt, not many would pass the opportunity of playing slots because of that. Most gamblers enjoy the itch of the anonymity of slot odds.</p>
                        <p class="p1">However, to ensure you win regularly, we recommend choosing slot games with high RTP percentages. A slot with 95% RTP going upwards is ideal. The payouts of winning paylines are automatically calculated and will be displayed. So, you’ll receive the appropriate payout if you win.</p>
                        <p class="p2">Where to Play Slots for Phillipines Players </p>
